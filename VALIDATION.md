## End-to-end proof

Demonstrate:

```text
code change
   ↓
pull request CI
   ↓
merge
   ↓
npm build
   ↓
Docker image
   ↓
ECR SHA tag
   ↓
GitOps desired-state update
   ↓
Argo CD sync
   ↓
EKS rolling deployment
   ↓
ALB / HTTPS
   ↓
metrics visible
```

Then identify the exact Git commit running in the cluster.
